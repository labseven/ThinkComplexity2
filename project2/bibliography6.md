# Social force model for pedestrian dynamics

Dirk Helbing and Péter Molnár model pedestrian traffic using a physics model with social forces. Each pedestrian has a goal, repels from walls and other individuals, and has 'distractions' that attract it (friends, posters, etc). Using this model, they show the emergent phenomena describe real-world pedestrian movements, like lane formation and crowd-door dynamics.
