# Risk-Pooling and Herd Survival: An Agent-Based Model of a Maasai Gift-Giving System

The researchers study and model osotua, a gift-giving tradition common among Massai in East Africa. Osotua creates a relationship of giving between two parties, and can be thought of as risk pooling. When a party is in need, they request from their partner what they need. They model two herds of livestock, with a minimum viable size. When disaster strikes one of the herds, the owner of that herd requests the missing number of livestock from their partner, who choses to fulfill the request based on the size of their herd. They show that the osotua model vastly outperforms (in longevity) probabilistic exchange or no exchange. The model is quite simple, and the results seem to match the graphs.
