# The evolution of cooperation in an ecological context: an agent-based model

The researchers implement an agent based model of a herd grazing on plants. Two experiments are run. In one, agents have a chance of being attacked by predators, but can be saved by cooperating agents (which put themselves at risk). In the other, plants can be over grazed, cooperating agents only eat half of the plant's energy (instead of greedily almost killing it). In these models, the population always benefits from cooperation, but the cooperating gene tends to die off. The find that different distribution of plants could reinforce cooperative behavior by reducing mixing of groups.
