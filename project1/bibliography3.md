Hierarchical organization in complex networks

Ravasz and Barabási try to explain the mechanism for the creation of clustered scale-free networks in nature. They created a new formula for constructing a network, and showed that it is easily tuned to create different clustering and degree coefficients. The article explains how hierarchies are present in real world networks (actors, WWW, biology, etc.), but the research lacks a full exploration of the hierarchical nature of the new model. The model does not seem to account for the body of the power-law graphs (like most).
