Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani modeled disease spread over multiple different network models. They show that a uniform random immunization strategy is weak, and propose and analyze improved strategies for immunization. They found that scale-free networks are highly susceptible to epidemics, but discovered extremely effective strategies of immunization. They suggest that their model is relevant to the spreading of viruses over the internet, and propose a way to extend it to model STD transmission.
