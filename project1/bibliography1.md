Immunization of complex networks

Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani modeled disease spread over multiple networks. They show that a uniform random immunization strategy is not very efficient, and propose and analyze improved strategies for immunization. They found that scale-free networks are highly susceptible to epidemics, but discovered extremely effective strategies of immunization for it. They suggest that their model is relevant to the spreading of viruses over the internet, and propose a way to extend it to model STD transmission.
