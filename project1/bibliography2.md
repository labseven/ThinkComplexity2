Attack Vulnerability of complex networks

The authors analyze the attack vulnerability of ER, BA, clustered BA, and WS models. They simulate vertex attacks and edges attacks with multiple strategies against these networks, and show how robust they are. The data explain how different networks behave under an attack. Their graphs show interesting results for networks of different size and layout. They propose that their model strongly models the Internet, and is more weakly connected to geographical networks and disease spread.
